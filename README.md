# Random Password Generator

## Description

This application is a random password generator which allows the user to generate a random password. The user can select character type criteria for the generator to use when constructing a password. I built this application to test my knowledge of JavaScript including functions, methods, conditionals, and variables. Throughout this project I was able to better understand the syntax of JavaScript and the relationship between all of the elements. I hope you find my application useful!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, navigate to the URL provided below. First, click the "Generate Password" button to start the process. Next, a series of prompts will appear so the user can select which character types they'd like to be included in their password. The character types are upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Finally, the application will ask how many characters long the user wants their password to be. Now they will have a randomly generated password!!!
